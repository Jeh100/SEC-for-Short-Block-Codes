# Short-Block-Codes-with-Semantic-Correction-Outperform-Long-Codes

This repository contains the implementation for our paper submitted at **GLOBECOM 2025**.

## Requirements

Install all dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Planned updates

- [x] SEC (Semantic Error Correction)
- [ ] Model weights
- [ ] Semconf-HARQ

We will release more methods that tightly integrate SEC with channel coding in this repository. Some of these works have been submitted or will be submitted to journals such as **IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications (TWC)** and **IEEE Transactions on Communications (TCOM)**. Stay tuned!
